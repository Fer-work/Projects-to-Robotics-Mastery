# The Dragon's Domain: 50 Projects to Mastery

Welcome to the official repository for my journey into robotics, home automation, and craftsmanship. This is the central hub for all of the projects I'll be working on, from everyday quality-of-life improvements to ambitious, "Jarvis"-level home automation, and even some fun, creative builds.

My mission is to systematically build my skills and my workshop's capabilities, documenting every step of the way. This isn't just about the final products; it's about the process of learning, designing, building, and problem-solving. It's about becoming an architect of my own environment.

I plan to record my progress and upload regular updates to social media, with a more detailed showcase video on YouTube once each project is complete.

### The Philosophy

Inspired by makers, builders, and the spirit of "Dr. Stone," my approach is to learn by doing. I believe in "over-engineering" for the sake of mastery—building things to be robust, understandable, and a source of pride. This journey will cover:

- **Software Development:** Full-stack web applications for control and monitoring.
- **Electronics:** From basic circuits to complex IoT devices.
- **Mechatronics & Robotics:** Combining mechanics, electronics, and software to create moving, interactive machines.
- **Fabrication:** Building my own tools, like a 3D printer and CNC, to achieve true creative independence.

### The Project Roadmap

This repository is structured as a "monorepo," with each project contained in its own numbered folder. You can follow the complete 50-project plan and see my progress in real-time.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Let's see what we can build.
