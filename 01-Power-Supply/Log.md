# Project Log: 01 - The Lab Bench Power Supply

A daily journal of progress, problems, and solutions.

---

### **July 11, 2025**

- **Task:** Began organizing components for the build. Laid out the main parts on the workbench.
- **Problem:** Realized I'm missing my 24V transformers and solder.
- **Solution:** Will start by prototyping the regulator circuits on a breadboard using a temporary power source. Will order new solder tomorrow.

### **July 12, 2025**

- **Task:** Watched the DroneBot Workshop video on linear power supplies. Sketched out the initial schematic for the multi-output design.
- **Problem:** Unsure about the correct heat sink size for the LM317 regulator under full load.
- **Solution:** Found a datasheet with thermal resistance calculations. Will work through the math next session.

### **July 14, 2025**

- **Task:** Built the bridge rectifier and main filter capacitor stage on the breadboard.
- **Problem:** None. The output was a clean, albeit high, DC voltage as expected.
- **Solution:** N/A. Milestone achieved.
