# Project 01: The Lab Bench Power Supply

**Goal:** To design and build a multi-output DC power supply for my electronics workshop, providing fixed 24V, 12V, 5V outputs, and a variable 1.25V-30V output.

### Key Learnings

- Learned the importance of heat sinks for voltage regulators.
- Discovered that the actual output of my transformer was higher than rated under no load.
- This project solidified my understanding of AC to DC rectification.
